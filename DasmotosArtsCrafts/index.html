<!-- I used a second p element to get the text and images to line up.  Regular span and div weren't getting the right look I was attempting.  There probably is a much better way to do it, I just don't know how. I also noticed on Slack most people were trying to stay close to the example given.  I found it unattractive, so I hope I don't get penalised for drawing outside the lines by creating a new look. -->
